SN74HC126N PINOUT DIAGRAM
=========================
Quad Tri-State Buffer (14-pin DIP)

         +-----v-----+
    1OE  |1        14| VCC (3.3V)
    1A   |2        13| 4OE
    1Y   |3        12| 4A
    2OE  |4        11| 4Y
    2A   |5        10| 3OE
    2Y   |6         9| 3A
    GND  |7         8| 3Y
         +-----------+

ORBIGATOR CONNECTIONS (Using Buffer 1 only):
=============================================

Pin 1  (1OE) ← GP2 (Direction Control)
Pin 2  (1A)  ← GP0 (UART TX from Pico)
Pin 3  (1Y)  → DATA BUS (to Dynamixel motors)
Pin 7  (GND) → Common Ground
Pin 14 (VCC) → 3.3V from Pico

UNUSED PINS (Buffers 2, 3, 4):
- Pins 4, 5, 6 (Buffer 2)
- Pins 8, 9, 10 (Buffer 3)
- Pins 11, 12, 13 (Buffer 4)
- Leave floating or tie OE pins to GND to disable

OPERATION:
==========
When 1OE (Pin 1) = HIGH:
  - Buffer is ENABLED
  - 1Y (Pin 3) outputs the signal from 1A (Pin 2)
  - Pico transmits to motors

When 1OE (Pin 1) = LOW:
  - Buffer is TRI-STATED (high impedance)
  - 1Y (Pin 3) is disconnected
  - Motors can transmit back to Pico on DATA line

SIGNAL FLOW:
============
TX Mode (GP2=HIGH):
  Pico GP0 → Pin 2 (1A) → Pin 3 (1Y) → DATA BUS → Motors

RX Mode (GP2=LOW):
  Motors → DATA BUS → Pico GP1 (direct connection)
  (Pin 3 is tri-stated, doesn't interfere)

CRITICAL NOTES:
===============
1. VCC must be 3.3V (74HC series is 3.3V compatible)
2. Do NOT use 74LS126 (requires 5V, not compatible)
3. GP2 must be set HIGH before transmitting
4. GP2 must be set LOW to receive motor responses
5. Add 0.1µF bypass capacitor between VCC and GND
