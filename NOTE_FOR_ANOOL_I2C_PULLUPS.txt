IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ANOOL - I2C PULL-UP RESISTORS
================================================
Date: 2025-12-20

ISSUE DISCOVERED:
-----------------
The OLED display was experiencing glitching on the top line during operation.
Initially thought to be a software issue, but turned out to be hardware.

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
Missing external I2C pull-up resistors on the shared I2C bus.

When using MULTIPLE I2C devices (OLED + RTC) on the same bus, the built-in 
pull-ups on individual modules are NOT sufficient. The bus needs stronger 
pull-ups to maintain signal integrity.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
---------------------
Added two 4.7kΩ pull-up resistors:
- R2: 4.7kΩ from SDA (GP4) to +3.3V
- R3: 4.7kΩ from SCL (GP5) to +3.3V

VERIFICATION:
-------------
- Touching wires with finger (adding capacitance) temporarily stabilized display
- Adding proper 4.7kΩ pull-ups completely fixed the glitching
- Display now updates smoothly at 1 Hz

CRITICAL FOR PCB DESIGN:
------------------------
When designing the Orbigator PCB, MUST include:
1. 4.7kΩ resistor from SDA to 3.3V
2. 4.7kΩ resistor from SCL to 3.3V

These are REQUIRED for reliable I2C communication with multiple devices.
Do NOT rely on module-internal pull-ups alone!

UPDATED DOCUMENTATION:
----------------------
- ORBIGATOR_CIRCUIT_DIAGRAM.txt now shows R2 and R3 pull-up resistors
- Critical connections section updated with I2C pull-up requirements
