SERVO CONFIGURATION:
--------------------
Servo #1: ID = 1 (LAN Motor - Longitude of Ascending Node)
Servo #2: ID = 2 (AOV Motor - Argument of Perigee/True Anomaly)

Both servos:
  - Baud Rate: 57600 bps (default)
  - Protocol: DYNAMIXEL Protocol 2.0
  - Voltage: 5V (range 3.7V-6V)
  - Communication: Half-duplex TTL (shared DATA line)


CRITICAL NOTES:
---------------
1. DO NOT power servos from Pico VBUS - use external 5V supply (4-5A minimum)
2. All grounds MUST be connected together (common ground)
3. 10kΩ pull-up resistor on DATA line is REQUIRED
4. GP2 controls direction: HIGH = transmit, LOW = receive
5. I2C devices (OLED + RTC) share same bus on GP4/GP5
6. Encoder uses internal pull-ups on GP6/GP7/GP8
7. Each servo must have unique ID (set via DYNAMIXEL Wizard or commands)
8. 74HC126 only uses Gate 1 (pins 1-3), other gates unused
